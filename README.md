Face-controlled Android launcher

Hmmm, maybe I left the changes on an old laptop cus I coulda sworn I made more progress than this repo would indicate, but...

This was an ill-fated attempt at making an Android launcher controlled through the camera by the movements of your head.  IIRC my primary setbacks when I was initially working on this were 1) a limited amount of time, and 2) the tutorials and documentation I was working from were outright buggy, including on Google's end.  #2 has probably changed over the past several years, but #1 is a tricky beast.  Even so, I want to leave this repo public in its infantile state, because I still think it was a pretty funny idea :P

Proposed features:
* Front camera input is displayed full-screen behind a transparent display of all the apps on your phone
* Scroll the apps list by turning your head to either side. One way scrolls up, the other scrolls down! (If we're just proposing stuff, it should probably be LTR/RTL sensitive lol)
* Open an app by opening your mouth and chomping on its icon!!!
* This is entirely practical and not at all stupid
